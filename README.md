# Huntsman-POCS
POCS on the Huntsman Telephoto Array

Responsible for the operation of the Huntsman Telephoto Array, this uses [POCS](https://github.com/panoptes/POCS) as its base with a few custom features added.

The Huntsman Telephoto Array is an AAO & Macquarie University project to take images of faint galaxy structures using off the shelf camera lenses.
